Onboarding starts on the webpage: https://www.appbooka.com/onboarding

After the final stage after pressing on button Start Reading should be opened the page where customer can choose a subscription: reference: https://buddy.ai/en/eld-prices. (https://buddy.ai/en/eld-prices) We will leave here only 1-year subscription with no trial and 1 month subscription with trial.

Please use the same colours, buttons and styles on this page as you used in the onboarding.

After Choosing the plan we have to make a customer to create an account here: https://appbooka.com/registration

After registration, we have to go to the Stripe subscription page (should be customised in the same way as the payment page)

After successful payment and subscription, the data should be passed to revenue can and to our admin panel that this account bought the subscription in web.
